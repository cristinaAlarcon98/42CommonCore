# 42LCommonCore

The 42 Common Core started in Paris in 2013 and has been evolving ever since. The program challenges students to complete projects and earn points to level up as they go.

In this repository, you’ll find the code I’ve been working on since I started at 42 London’s Common Core on November 26, 2024. I’m always improving the code and adding new projects. The first ones are written in C, and I’ll be moving into C++ as I progress.
