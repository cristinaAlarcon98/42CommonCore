# CommonCore42London

The 42 Common Core program started in Paris back in 2013 and has been constantly updated and refined ever since. Students move forward by completing projects and earning points, which help them level up.

This repository contains code from my time at 42 Portoâ€™s Common Core, starting on November 26, 2024. The first few projects are written in C, with plans to transition into C++ later on.
